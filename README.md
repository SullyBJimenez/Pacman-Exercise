# Pacman-Exercise

This pacman excerise uses elements like callback functions to get the image to continuously move. Functions were created to check the page bounds and then through the DOM I am able to move the pacman image back and forth

You can run this program through VS code and opening the .HTML file in your browser.

Hopes for improvement
Continue to build it out into an actual pacman game with controls and fruits to eat
